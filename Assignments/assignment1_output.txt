Question 1.2.


6 examples that illustrate how the presence or absence of primary and
foreign keys affects insert and deletes in these relations


Example 1: Inserting tuple with and without primary key


inserting without primary key

CREATE TABLE
INSERT 0 3
 sid | sname  | rating 
-----+--------+--------
  22 | Dustin |      7
  22 | Dustin |      7
  22 | Dustin |      7
(3 rows)

 Without primary key we can insert same tuple multiple times without any restriction.
DROP TABLE

inserting with primary key

CREATE TABLE
INSERT 0 1

inserting same tuple again

psql:/Users/vibhas/Desktop/MSDS/Spring_2020/2AdvancedDatabaseConcepts/ADC_assignments/1/assignment1.sql:47: ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "sailor_pkey"
DETAIL:  Key (sid)=(22) already exists.
 sid | sname  | rating 
-----+--------+--------
  22 | Dustin |      7
(1 row)

There is only one tuple in the relation even when we tried to insert two same tuples. primary key do not allow multiple insertion with similar primary key values.

DROP TABLE


Example 2: Deleting tuple with and without primary key


relation without primary key constraint

CREATE TABLE
INSERT 0 3
 sid | sname  | rating 
-----+--------+--------
  22 | Dustin |      7
  22 | Dustin |      7
  22 | Dustin |      7
(3 rows)


there are 3 entires with same sid, now I try to delete one tuple of sid = 22
DELETE 3
 sid | sname | rating 
-----+-------+--------
(0 rows)

all tuples with sid =22 are deleted, so we have no control over any specific tuple when deleting.
DROP TABLE

relation with primary key constraint
CREATE TABLE
INSERT 0 3
 sid | sname  | rating 
-----+--------+--------
  22 | Dustin |      7
  29 | Brutus |      1
  31 | Lubber |      8
(3 rows)

Now with primary key, we wont have two tuple with all similar variable and we will be able to delete selectively
DELETE 1
 sid | sname  | rating 
-----+--------+--------
  29 | Brutus |      1
  31 | Lubber |      8
(2 rows)

DROP TABLE


Example 3: Inserting tuple with foreign key references


when two relation are referenced with foreign key, tuple in relation with foreign key can only be inserted if it
satisfies the foreign key constraint else it will not be inserted
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
I made two tables, sailor and reserves, reserves has foreign key sid referenced to sailor.sid
INSERT 0 2
 sid | sname  | rating 
-----+--------+--------
  22 | Dustin |      7
  29 | Brutus |      1
(2 rows)

inserted two entires in sailor with sid 22 and 29.

trying to insert data in table reserves with sid already in sailor table
INSERT 0 2
 sid | bid |   day   
-----+-----+---------
  22 | 101 | Monday
  22 | 102 | Tuesday
(2 rows)


trying to insert data in table reserves with sid not present in sailor table
psql:/Users/vibhas/Desktop/MSDS/Spring_2020/2AdvancedDatabaseConcepts/ADC_assignments/1/assignment1.sql:138: ERROR:  insert or update on table "reserves" violates foreign key constraint "reserves_sid_fkey"
DETAIL:  Key (sid)=(30) is not present in table "sailor".
 sid | bid |   day   
-----+-----+---------
  22 | 101 | Monday
  22 | 102 | Tuesday
(2 rows)

the insertion is rejected as it violates foreign key constraint
DROP TABLE


Example 4: Dropping table with foreign key reference when cascade is allowed and cascade is not allowed


Dropping table when cascading is not allowed.
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
created three tables Sailor, Boat and Reserves

Dropping tables when cascading is not allowed
              Table "public.reserves"
 Column |  Type   | Collation | Nullable | Default 
--------+---------+-----------+----------+---------
 sid    | integer |           | not null | 
 bid    | integer |           | not null | 
 day    | text    |           |          | 
Indexes:
    "reserves_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (sid, bid)
Foreign-key constraints:
    "reserves_bid_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (bid) REFERENCES boat(bid)
    "reserves_sid_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (sid) REFERENCES sailor(sid)

psql:/Users/vibhas/Desktop/MSDS/Spring_2020/2AdvancedDatabaseConcepts/ADC_assignments/1/assignment1.sql:177: ERROR:  cannot drop table sailor because other objects depend on it
DETAIL:  constraint reserves_sid_fkey on table reserves depends on table sailor
HINT:  Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.
The description shows that the foreign key restriction did not allow Sailor to be dropped.
DROP TABLE

dropping table when cascading is allowed
CREATE TABLE
created three tables Reserves with cascading allowed.
              Table "public.reserves"
 Column |  Type   | Collation | Nullable | Default 
--------+---------+-----------+----------+---------
 sid    | integer |           | not null | 
 bid    | integer |           | not null | 
 day    | text    |           |          | 
Indexes:
    "reserves_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (sid, bid)
Foreign-key constraints:
    "reserves_bid_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (bid) REFERENCES boat(bid) ON DELETE CASCADE
    "reserves_sid_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (sid) REFERENCES sailor(sid) ON DELETE CASCADE

psql:/Users/vibhas/Desktop/MSDS/Spring_2020/2AdvancedDatabaseConcepts/ADC_assignments/1/assignment1.sql:195: NOTICE:  drop cascades to constraint reserves_sid_fkey on table reserves
DROP TABLE
              Table "public.reserves"
 Column |  Type   | Collation | Nullable | Default 
--------+---------+-----------+----------+---------
 sid    | integer |           | not null | 
 bid    | integer |           | not null | 
 day    | text    |           |          | 
Indexes:
    "reserves_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (sid, bid)
Foreign-key constraints:
    "reserves_bid_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (bid) REFERENCES boat(bid) ON DELETE CASCADE

The description shows that the foreign key restriction are removed when we try to drop Sailor table.
DROP TABLE


Example 5: Deleting tuple without foreign key when cascading is allowed


We can delete tuple with CASCADE command when cascading is allowed.
creating two table Sailor and Reserves in which cascading is allowed
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
INSERT 0 2
 sid | sname  | rating 
-----+--------+--------
  22 | Dustin |      7
  29 | Brutus |      1
(2 rows)

inserted two entires in sailor with sid 22 and 29.

trying to insert data in table reserves table
INSERT 0 2
 sid | bid |   day   
-----+-----+---------
  22 | 101 | Monday
  29 | 102 | Tuesday
(2 rows)

Deleting from sailor the entry with sid = 29. It will also be deleted from Reserves table automatically
DELETE 1
 sid | sname  | rating 
-----+--------+--------
  22 | Dustin |      7
(1 row)

 sid | bid |  day   
-----+-----+--------
  22 | 101 | Monday
(1 row)

The entry with sid 29 is deleted from both tables.
DROP TABLE


Example 6: Deleting tuple without foreign key when deletion is restricted.


We can not delete tuple with CASCADE command when cascading is RESTRICTED.
creating two table Sailor and Reserves in which cascading is restricted
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
INSERT 0 2
 sid | sname  | rating 
-----+--------+--------
  22 | Dustin |      7
  29 | Brutus |      1
(2 rows)

inserted two entires in sailor with sid 22 and 29.

trying to insert data in table reserves table
INSERT 0 2
 sid | bid |   day   
-----+-----+---------
  22 | 101 | Monday
  29 | 102 | Tuesday
(2 rows)

Deleting from sailor the entry with sid = 29. It not be allowed to be deleted from tables
psql:/Users/vibhas/Desktop/MSDS/Spring_2020/2AdvancedDatabaseConcepts/ADC_assignments/1/assignment1.sql:279: ERROR:  update or delete on table "sailor" violates foreign key constraint "reserves_sid_fkey" on table "reserves"
DETAIL:  Key (sid)=(29) is still referenced from table "reserves".
 sid | sname  | rating 
-----+--------+--------
  22 | Dustin |      7
  29 | Brutus |      1
(2 rows)

 sid | bid |   day   
-----+-----+---------
  22 | 101 | Monday
  29 | 102 | Tuesday
(2 rows)

The entry with sid 29 is not deleted form both tables.
DROP TABLE
