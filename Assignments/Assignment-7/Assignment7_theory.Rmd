### Question 6.A

The ER diagram has been made with following assumptions:  
- All relationships are many-to-many.  
- A Student can buy multiple books.  
- A Student can enroll in multiple courses.  
- Student can have multiple majors.   
- Book can cite multiple books.  
Major is an entity with an attribute major, majors_in is a relation that connects Student and Major.

### Question 7.a

MATCH (:Student )-[r]->()   
RETURN type(r)  

### Question 7.b

MATCH(s: student{sname: 'John'}) - [:buys]->(b:book)  
where b.price >=50  
return s  

### Question 7.c

MATCH(s:student) -[:buys]-> (b1:book),  
(b1) -[:cites]-> (b2:book)  
where b2.price >= 50  
return s  

### Question 7.d

MATCH (b1: Book) - [:cites*] -> (b2:book)  
where b1.price >50  
return b2  
 
### Question 7.e

MATCH (b:book)<-[:buys]-(s:student),  
(s)-[:majors_in]->(m1:Major{major:'Math'}),  
(s)-[:majors_in]->(m2:Major{major:'CS'})  
return b, count(s)
